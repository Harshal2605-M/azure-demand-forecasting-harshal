🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end Cloud Demand Forecasting & Capacity Optimization system built using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Gen2, and Power BI.

It shows how large-scale enterprise data — coming from Snowflake, GCP, and REST APIs — can be collected, unified, cleaned, modeled, and visualized using a fully scalable cloud architecture.

The system helps cloud service providers or internal cloud teams to:

  Analyze compute & storage usage

  Forecast next-month and next-year cloud demand

  Compare ML model performance (MAPE-based)

  Identify region-wise growth patterns

  Optimize resource allocation across Azure regions

🧱 Medallion Architecture
  🔶 Bronze Layer – Raw Data

    Direct ingestion from Snowflake, GCP, and API

    No transformations

    Schema-aligned storage

    Files stored as received for auditing

  Raw Datasets Used:

    demand_data.csv

    external_factors.csv

    feature_engineering_data.csv

  🔷 Silver Layer – Cleaned/Structured Data

    cleaning & handling missing values

    Standardizing column formats

    Joining compute + storage + external datasets

     Time-series feature creation (Day, Month, Region, Season)

  Calculating KPI fields like:
    ✔ usage_units
    ✔ peak_usage_units
    ✔ cloud_demand_index
    ✔ week-over-week growth

  🟡 Gold Layer – Analytics & Modeling

    Aggregated demand tables

    Region-level and service-level summaries

    Feature-engineered datasets for ML

    Final tables exported to Power BI

🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

  A dedicated forecasting notebook in Databricks trains multiple models for each Azure region and service (Compute & Storage).

  ML Workflow Includes:

    Loop through each region (West Europe, East US, Central India)

  Train multiple models:

    1.Prophet

    2.XGBoost

    3.Random Forest

    4.Holt-Winters

    5.ARIMA

  Calculate MAPE for every model

  Select the best-performing model per region

  Generate daily forecast for next month

  Generate 12-month forecast for next year

  Store results in Gold Layer

  Export outputs for Power BI dashboards

📊 Power BI Dashboards

  The final results are visualized using interactive dashboards with drill-through navigation.
